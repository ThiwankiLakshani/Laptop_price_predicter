# Laptop Price Predictor using Machine Learning

## Description

Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor using Machine Learning! This project is aimed at guiding you through building a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features such as processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, and more. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this tutorial will help you understand the process of training a predictive model and deploying it to make accurate price predictions.

### Features

- **Predictive Model**: Train a machine learning model using regression algorithms to predict laptop prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
- **Web Interface**: Build a simple web interface to allow users to input laptop specifications and get predicted prices.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to handle large datasets and provide accurate predictions in real-time.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: A versatile programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and web development.
- **Scikit-learn**: A popular machine learning library in Python used for building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library in Python used for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web application framework in Python used for building web interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the user interface of the web application.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Laptop Price Predictor on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git
   cd laptop-price-predictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to open and run the notebook `train_model.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model.

4. **Start the Web Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the laptop price predictor.

### Folder Structure
